# VaRA tool suite

## Setup tool suite
```bash
    > ./initVaRA-TS.sh
```
This initializes `VaRA-TS`, by initializing the `benchbuild` submodule and creating symlinks into `benchbuild`, for VaRA's project and experiment descriptions.

### benchbuild projects
`VaRA-TS` defines a set of projects that can be analyzed with `benchbuild`.
```
    benchbuild
    └── projects
```

### benchbuild experiments
`VaRA-TS` defines a set of projects that can be analyzed with `benchbuild`.
```
    benchbuild
    └── experiments
```
